// Usage instructions: Create a single array variable named 'activity'. This
// represents explanatory text and one or more questions to present to the
// student. Each element in the array should itself be either
//
// -- a string containing a set of complete HTML elements. That is, if the
//    string contains an open HTML tag (such as <form>), it must also have the
//    corresponding close tag (such as </form>). You put the actual question
//    text in a string.
//
// -- a JavaScript object representing the answer information for a question.
//    That is, the object contains properties such as the type of question, a
//    regular expression indicating the correct answer, a string to show in
//    case of either correct or incorrect answers or to show when the student
//    asks for help. For more information on how to specify the object, please
//    see http://code.google.com/p/course-builder/wiki/CreateActivities.
